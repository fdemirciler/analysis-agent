## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. **WebSocket over REST**: Chosen for real-time user feedback during file processing and query execution
2. **Modular Tool System**: Designed for easy extension with additional analysis capabilities
3. **LLM Provider Abstraction**: Enables switching between different AI services without code changes
4. **Pydantic Validation**: Ensures type safety and clear API contracts

### Performance Considerations
- File processing happens asynchronously with progress updates
- LLM responses cached at session level
- Minimal frontend JavaScript for fast loading

### Security Measures
- File upload validation by extension
- Temporary file cleanup
- Environment variable configuration
- CORS middleware for development
